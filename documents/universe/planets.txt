PLANETS OF THE NOVARA GALAXY

Planet Zephyria
Located in the outer rim of the Novara Galaxy, Zephyria is known for its perpetual winds that reach speeds of up to 500 kilometers per hour. The planet has three moons: Luna Prime, Whisper, and Echo. The atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, making it habitable for most carbon-based life forms. The indigenous population, known as the Zephyrians, have developed unique architecture that harnesses wind energy. The capital city, Aeroport, is built on floating platforms that drift with the wind currents.

Planet Crystallia
Crystallia is a mineral-rich world covered in massive crystal formations that can grow up to 2 kilometers in height. These crystals emit a soft bioluminescent glow during the planet's 36-hour night cycle. The planet orbits a binary star system, resulting in complex seasonal patterns. Crystallia is the primary source of Luminite, a rare mineral used in advanced energy systems throughout the galaxy. Mining operations are strictly regulated by the Galactic Council to preserve the planet's natural beauty.

Planet Aquanis
A water world with only 5% land mass, Aquanis is home to the most diverse marine ecosystem in the known universe. The oceans reach depths of over 50 kilometers in some regions. The planet's two continents, Northern Isle and Southern Isle, serve as research stations and spaceports. Underwater cities built by the aquatic Aquanians dot the ocean floor. The planet's unique tidal system, influenced by its four moons, creates spectacular tsunami waves that can reach heights of 100 meters during moon alignment.

Planet Terraforge
An artificial planet constructed over 5,000 years ago by an ancient civilization known as the Architects. Terraforge features modular biomes that can be reconfigured to simulate environments from any known world. It serves as the galaxy's premier diplomatic meeting place and cultural exchange center. The planet's core contains a massive computational matrix that maintains its environmental systems. Approximately 50 million beings from over 1,000 different species reside on Terraforge.

Planet Cindermoor
A volcanic world with extreme temperatures reaching 800 degrees Celsius on the surface. Despite the harsh conditions, silicon-based life forms thrive in the lava flows. The Cinderians have evolved to withstand extreme heat and can manipulate molten rock. The planet is famous for its Fireforges, natural geological formations where rare alloys form spontaneously. These alloys are highly sought after for starship construction due to their heat resistance and durability.
